- Analyzed and restructured a monolithic D3 globe project into a modular, maintainable architecture

- Extracted 6 custom hooks from a 577-line component (useGeoData, useDimensions, useD3Projection,
  useGlobeInteraction, useGlobeZoom, useGlobeState)

- Created reusable UI components with CSS Modules (SliderControl, ProjectionToggle, DarkModeToggle,
  ActionButtons, Button)

- Organized utilities and types into domain-specific modules (d3-helpers, math, download, theme,
  constants)

- Achieved dramatic complexity reduction: Globe component 577→116 lines (80%), App component 225→58
  lines (74%)

- Maintained full functionality while improving code quality - all TypeScript checks and ESLint
  rules passing

- Committed changes with proper conventional commit format and pre-commit hook validation

- Created comprehensive README documenting features, architecture, setup, and development workflow

- **Result**: Transformed a hard-to-maintain codebase into a scalable, well-documented project following
  React best practices with clear separation of concerns.
