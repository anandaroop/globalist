# Claude session summary

This was _after_ the first couple of short sesions to scaffold the SPA, add a d3 globe, and implement the first (longitude) slider.

         Here's a concise summary of the AI coding session:
```

- **Central Parallel Slider**: Added a new slider to control the central parallel (latitude), allowing rotation around the Y-axis.

- **Direct Globe Manipulation (Attempt 1 - Reverted)**: Initial attempt at dragging used a simple pixel-to-rotation conversion, which resulted in a 2D panning feel and inverted rotation direction.

- **Direct Globe Manipulation (Attempt 2 - Reverted)**: Implemented a trackball-style interaction using 3D sphere mathematics, converting screen coordinates to 3D sphere points and calculating rotations to keep the contact point "glued" to the cursor. This version also inverted the rotation direction.

- **Trackball Direct Manipulation (Corrected)**: Implemented a correct trackball algorithm that converts mouse positions to 3D sphere coordinates and calculates rotations based on the arc between positions, ensuring natural feel and correct rotation direction.

- **Coordinate Input Precision Fix**: Limited the precision of longitude and latitude inputs to one decimal place and set the step size to 0.1 for finer control.

- **Negative Number Input Bug (Attempted & Reverted)**: Attempted to fix an issue preventing negative number input by handling NaN gracefully, but this made the UX worse and was reverted.

- **Download SVG Button**: Added a "Download SVG" button to the Settings panel, allowing users to export the current globe view as an SVG file with coordinates in the filename.
- **Z-axis Rotation Slider**: Added a slider for z-axis rotation (perpendicular to the screen plane), which is controlled only by the slider and unaffected by dragging.

- **Projection Toggle**: Implemented a radio button toggle to switch between orthographic and d3.geoSatellite projections.

- **d3-geo-projection TypeScript Declarations**: Added a custom TypeScript declaration file (d3-geo-projection.d.ts) to resolve "implicitly has an 'any' type" and "Property 'distance' does not exist" errors for the d3-geo-projection module.

- **Projection Size Normalization**: Fixed the issue where toggling projections drastically changed the globe's apparent size by using different scale divisors for orthographic (baseSize / 2.15) and satellite (baseSize / 1.25) projections, along with a refined satellite distance (2.0).

- **Zoom Slider**: Added a "Zoom" slider (range 1.0x to 8.0x) to control the globe's magnification, allowing it to look more like a traditional rectangular map at high zoom levels.

- **Scroll Wheel Zoom**: Implemented zoom functionality via scroll wheel (and two-finger trackpad swipe), mapping deltaY to zoom changes and preventing default scroll behavior.

- **Smooth Scroll Wheel Zoom Optimization**: Addressed jittery zoom animation by updating the D3 projection's scale directly (instead of re-creating the entire projection) and using a useRef to track the current zoom value to prevent stale state issues in rapid wheel events.

- **Reset Button**: Added a "Reset" button to re-initialize all map state parameters to their default values (0 for rotations, 1.0 for zoom, orthographic for projection) with grayscale styling.
