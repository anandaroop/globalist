Had to switch to Opus to debug this initial render problem, but in the end it took a human nudge from me to make Claude consider the data fetching lifecycle.

Globe Initial Render Sizing Bug Fix

Problem Identified:

- Globe rendered too small on initial page load
- Correct size only appeared after browser window resize
- Issue was related to data fetching and component lifecycle timing

Root Cause Analysis:

- useDimensions hook initialized with hardcoded dimensions (800x600)
- During data loading, Globe component showed loading state without containerRef
- After data loaded, container appeared but dimension measurement had already failed
- ResizeObserver only triggered on actual resize events, not initial mount

Solution Implemented:

- Changed initial dimensions from {width: 800, height: 600} to {width: 0, height: 0}
- Converted from useRef to callback ref pattern in useDimensions hook
- Added immediate dimension measurement when container element is attached
- Updated TypeScript types from RefObject to RefCallback
- Kept ResizeObserver for ongoing resize detection

Key Changes:

- src/hooks/useDimensions.ts - Complete rewrite using callback ref pattern
- src/types/globe.types.ts - Updated interface to support callback refs
- Removed unnecessary dimension checks from Globe component (false starts)

Result:

- Globe now renders at correct size immediately on initial load
- Maintains responsive behavior on window resize
- Works correctly regardless of data loading timing
